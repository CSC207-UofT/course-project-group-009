**As a group, answer the following questions:**

**1.  For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:**  
      
   **(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or**  
      
   **(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.**  


**Principle 1: Equitable Use**

Our program relies on a command-line user interface. Hence, our program is not equitable towards those who are unable to type in commands into the program. In the future, we could implement a graphical user interface with buttons so that users do not have to type in commands. 

**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**

Our program is not flexible as it demands users to type in commands (i.e. what product they would like to purchase/modify/etc.). We do not offer any alternative to typing in commands. In the future, we could implement a GUI alongside our current CUI to provide users with more choice and flexibility. 

**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**

Our program's main menu is quite simple and intuitive to use. In our `MenuUI`, a user simply needs to enter a number associated with what action they would like to take. For instance, if a user wants to view `product categories`, they first enter `1`. When presented with a list of product categories, the user then enters a second number to select a particular category. i.e. The user could select `4` for `Household Supplies`, etc. So our program is quite simple and intuitive in this respect. Furthermore, our command line occasionally allows the user to simply enter any key to return to a previous menu. 

**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**

Our program contrasts essential information like input commands by putting them in brackets []. This allows us to easily provide instructions and directions to the user. If a user wants to perform an action, they simply need to enter what is contained in the brackets []. 

**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**

This principle does not really apply to our program as our program does not have any hazards or  consequences to accidental or unintended actions. However, since our program is based on a command-line, there is little tolerance for input error as the user must enter a particular command exactly. We could improve this with a GUI with buttons. 


**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**

Our program allows users to maintain a neutral body position while interacting with the program. However, given that we require users to type in commands, there is a fair bit of repetitive actions (i.e. retyping similar commands). 

**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**

Our program is based on a command-line interface. Hence, a user must be standing or seated closed enough to a screen to read instructions, and close enough to a keyboard to type in commands. There is little alternative to the above. However, given that this is a computer program, it is not unreasonably demanding. 



**2.  Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**  

Our program is an inventory management system for a wholesale company. Hence, we would likely market our program towards wholesalers, small and large businesses. Our customers would ideally be selling large quantities of product and would need to keep accurate track of stock quantities, prices, etc. Our program was inspired by a wholesale business like Costco.   
      

**3.  Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.**

Our program uses JSON files to store data related to products. Each JSON file stores product names, prices, and stock quantities. Each JSON file is associated with a product category. Adding a new product category is accomplished by adding a new JSON file with products. Hence, users of our program would likely need to have some basic understanding of JSON files to be able to add new product categories. They would need to have the name, price, unit, and stock quantity of each product written in the JSON file. Hence, users with limited computer skills may struggle with this aspect of our program. 

Furthermore, our program would only be useful to a business demographic that would need to keep track of a large number of products. Hence, our program would not likely be used by demographics without this particular business need.
