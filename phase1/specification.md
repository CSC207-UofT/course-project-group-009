## Updated Specification for Phase 1
  
**Wholesale Inventory Management System**  
  
An inventory management system for a wholesale business similar to Costco. The inventory system can be accessed by two types of users (administrators and customers) using login credentials (username and password). The inventory system has an inventory that contains all of the store products. There is a name, price, and stock quantity associated with each product in the inventory.  
  
Each customer is able to add products to a personal shopping cart. Customers can add a desired quantity of a particular product if that product is available and if there is a sufficient quantity of that product in stock. Administrators are able to add new products to the inventory, modify prices of products, and modify product stock quantities.  **Store products are organized by categories (i.e. fruits and vegetables, household products, etc. )**

Store memberships are available which can provide store discounts to customers. Memberships will have an associated membership number, membership expiration date, mobile number, payment method, and shipping address.

**Note:** Changes to the specification from Phase 0 is in bold above.
